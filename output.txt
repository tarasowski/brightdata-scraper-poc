Everything is pristine and charming: rainbow-hued buildings line the canals; there are historic landmarks, Michelin-starred restaurants, cool cafes galore; and locals exude the laidback <>hygge</>mentality, cruising around on bicycles with flowers and freshly baked cinnamon buns in their baskets.</><>Sleek Scandinavian design and classical European grandeur is presented with equal enthusiasm, which is perhaps why it was named the World Capital of Architecture by UNESCO in 2023. And beyond the Danish capital’s aesthetic highlights, it boasts a variety of unique cultural attractions, from the whimsical <>Tivoli Gardens </>– the world’s oldest (and undoubtedly, the most elegant) theme park, to royal palaces, and The National Gallery of Denmark, where art aficionados admire Danish treasures alongside an impressive Matisse collection.</><>With a wave of hip new developments and Scandinavian Airlines flying direct from nine US cities, there has never been a better time to <>plan your trip</>.

It has been a perennial favorite for over 250 years, hosting a revolving door of world leaders and luminaries that would accept nothing less than excellence. And excellence you are guaranteed, from the prime location in the center of Copenhagen’s largest public square, flanked by the Royal Danish Theater and Charlottenborg Palace, to luxurious rooms with sprawling marble bathrooms and every contemporary comfort that you could require.</><>Michelin-starred cuisine is on offer at the French-inspired Marchal, where you can order fine dining specialties like lobster topped with caviar and gougeres with truffle cream. And traditional Nordic spa treatments can be experienced at the hotel’s wellness center, Amazing Space, home to the only pool in inner Copenhagen. D'Angleterre seamlessly blends old-world grandeur with modern Scandinavian luxury, and it was ranked on <>Travel + Leisure’s</>World’s Best Awards in 2021 and 2023.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Kongens Nytorv</><>Distance From Airport:</>6 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Royal Danish Theater, Charlottenborg Palace, Amalienborg Palace, Nyhavn</><>Accessibility: </>Wheelchair accessible</><>Rates:</>From $788 per night</><>Wi-Fi: </>Complimentary</><><h2> <>Coco Hotel</></h2><>Coco Hotel</><>Book Now</><>Also available to book at <>Expedia.com</><>What We Like</><>This hotel takes sustainable hospitality to another level: it’s carbon negative, almost entirely plastic-free, and if you book a room on the hotel’s website, it will donate a tree on your behalf.</><>What to Consider</><>You’ll often find a DJ spinning decks in the courtyard at night – a dream for some, a nightmare for others.</><>Located in the hip Vesterbro neighborhood, this stylish 88-room hotel opened right before the pandemic and has since become one of the most coveted places to stay in Copenhagen. It featured on <>Travel + Leisure’s</>It List in 2022 and the World’s Best Awards in 2023, and as is often the case with any trendy new hotel, it is the destination <>du jour</>for professionals arriving for key cultural events, such as Copenhagen Fashion Week and 3daysofdesign.</><>Café Coco is located at the entrance of the hotel and is the primary dining offering on site, with a cool, casual atmosphere. But if you’re in the mood for something a bit more formal, Coco’s Mediterranean-inspired sister restaurant, Delphine, is located 30 steps away. Room sizes vary from singles at 150 square feet to junior suites at 270 square feet, and the larger rooms include a sitting area and bathtubs. Overall, it’s an excellent option for individuals, couples, and business travelers heading to Copenhagen.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Vesterbro</><>Distance From Airport:</>8 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>The Glyptotek Museum, The Meatpacking District, Tivoli, Sankt Jørgens&nbsp;Park</><>Accessibility: </>Wheelchair accessible</><>Rates:</>From $202 per night</><>Wi-Fi: </>Complimentary</><><h2> <>Hotel Sanders</></h2><>Hotel Sanders</><>Book Now</><>Also available to book at <>Expedia.com</><>What We Like</><>It’s full of mid-century character and is located just opposite the Royal Danish Theater.</><>What to Consider</><>Rooms do not have coffee machines or kettles.</><>Rendered in a calming neutral color palette, Hotel Sanders is a stylish boutique hotel with 53-rooms spread across four townhouses. It featured on <>Travel + Leisure’s</>It list in 2018 and is a popular option for design lovers, with rooms that look like they’ve been decorated over the decades rather than dressed in an artificial mid-century theme.</><>The location is ideal, right in the historic center by Nyhavn Canal (the picture that’s likely to come up when you Google “Copenhagen”), and it’s within walking distance to key attractions and cafes. On-site dining consists of Sanders Kitchen – an all-day eatery with a simple evening menu serving delicious seasonal fare (think: dishes like salt-baked celeriac, vol-au-vent, and stracciatella with pumpkin and sage), and it is also home to Tata – a vintage-style cocktail bar that comes alive at night with both locals and travelers alike.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Historic center, near Nyhavn Canal</><>Distance From Airport:</>5 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Nyhavn Canal, The Royal Theater, The New Opera House, Designmuseum Denmark, Amelienborg Palace</><>Accessibility: </>Wheelchair accessible</><>Rates:</>From $255 per night</><>Wi-Fi: </>Complimentary</><><h2> <>The Audo Residence</></h2><>The Audo Residence</><>Book Now</><>What We Like</><>It feels like stepping into an interior design photoshoot, which is unsurprising, given it’s the hospitality branch of luxury furniture brand, Audo Copenhagen.</><>What to Consider</><>It’s not a traditional hotel, so it lacks some of the standard facilities that you may require (however, if you want a workout, it has a partnership with popular local gym Nordic Strong).</><>With only 10 well-edited rooms, The Audo Residence takes the concept of a boutique hotel to another level, feeling part concept store, part Airbnb. The rooms are spacious, with different residential-style configurations, ranging from the penthouse to studio suites, and it features stylish decor throughout, with pieces from Audo’s contemporary furniture collection, all available for purchase, should you be inspired to recreate the look at home.</><>Bathrooms follow the same Scandi luxe theme, and there is a restaurant on site, where organic sharing plates are served during the day and a seasonal three-course menu is offered at night (a favorite is the rib-eye sandwich on brioche with wasabi and leek mayo). Also within the same complex is the official showroom for Audo Copenhagen, so if you’re a design aficionado, this is an excellent option.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Nordhavn</><>Distance From Airport:</>8 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Nordhavn Bassin, Rundetaarn, Strøget</><>Accessibility: </>Wheelchair accessible</><>Rates:</>From $405 per night</><>Wi-Fi: </>Complimentary</><><h2> <>Manon Les Suites</></h2><>Manon Les Suites</><>Book Now</><>Also available to book at <>Agoda</><>What We Like</><>It has a lovely tropical-style pool that feels more like Bali than Copenhagen – a unique culture mash.</><>What to Consider</><>If you’re seeking something that feels distinctly Scandinavian, this is not the place – it has a jungle-style theme rather than the classically minimalistic vibe that the city is known for.</><>Located in a former factory in the ultra-hip Vesterbro neighborhood, Manon Les Suites is unlike any other hotel in the city. The aesthetic takes inspiration from Bali, with a pool that is supremely photogenic and a rooftop that is perfect for sunbathing, should you want your city escape with a side of resort-esque relaxation. The 87 suites are generously sized, outfitted in eco-friendly furnishings with kitchenettes and sofa beds, making it a great option for families or groups of friends (especially if you don’t intend on having every meal out). The hotel’s restaurant, Chapung, is also notable, serving Asian fusion classics from the sixth floor overlooking the city.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Vesterbro</><>Distance From Airport:</>9 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Tivoli, Rundetårn, Glyptoteket, Rosenborg Castle</><>Accessibility</>: It is not ideal for wheelchair access given there are doorsteps in the rooms</><>Rates:</>From $245 per night</><>Wi-Fi: </>Complimentary</><><h2> <>Hotel Danmark</></h2><>Hotel Danmark</><>Book Now</><>Also available to book at <>Expedia.com</><>What We Like</><>It has a rooftop terrace with 360-degree views across the city, plus a complimentary wine hour.</><>What to Consider</><>Some of the smaller rooms are indeed <>small</>(as in, best suited for one person).</><>Hotel Danmark follows the classic Copenhagen formula of minimal decor, organic food, and a hipster-luxe vibe. Its standout attraction is the rooftop terrace, which offers impressive views across the city, and in the summer months, it hosts a series of events and musical acts, attracting a mix of local denizens and international guests. There are 89 rooms that are indeed compact: the largest of them all is the junior suite, which is 322 square feet, and the smallest is a mere 130 square feet – just enough space to undress and roll into bed. It also has a bunk room category, which is a great option for groups of friends touring the city and simply seeking a clean and modern crash pad with an abundance of photogenic backdrops.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Copenhagen Cultural District</><>Distance From Airport:</>4 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Tivoli, The National Museum, City Hall, Strøget</><>Accessibility: </>Wheelchair accessible</><>Rates:</>From $112 per night</><><h2> <>Nimb Hotel</></h2><>Nimb Hotel</><>Book Now</><>Also available to book at <>Expedia.com</><>What We Like</><>It is located at the edge of Tivoli – Copenhagen’s equivalent of Disneyland – so it is a great option for families with kids.</><>What to Consider</><>It is one of the more costly options in the city (but it is worth it in our opinion).</><>Tivoli is one of Copenhagen’s most beloved attractions and the Nimb Hotel sits right alongside its fairytale grounds on the western side of the gardens. The exterior looks more like an opulent Moorish palace rather than a historic Danish building, and it’s particularly enchanting at night, when it’s illuminated with glowing lights.</><>As for the actual accommodations, there are 38 spacious rooms with views across the theme park and the gardens, all furnished with elegant, modern interiors. Amenities are a step above standard, with Bang &amp; Olufsen televisions, Nespresso machines, cocktail cabinets filled with spirit decanters, and some with fireplaces and balconies. It also has a rooftop swimming pool and six restaurants on-site, so there are options to suit everyone.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Vesterbro</><>Distance From Airport:</>8 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Tivoli, The Kings Gardens, Amalienborg Palace</><>Accessibility: </>Nimb Hotel offers three rooms that are particularly suitable for wheelchair users: rooms 18, 21, and 37</><>Rates:</>From $998 per night</><><h2> <>Nobis Hotel</></h2><>Nobis Copenhagen</><>Book Now</><>Also available to book at<>Mr &amp; Mrs Smith</><>What We Like</><>This Swedish-owned property is centrally located and luxurious, with detail-oriented decor and service.</><>What to Consider</><>Some of the rooms are located on street level and people can peer in, so there is not a lot of privacy – we would suggest requesting something on a higher level.</><>Located in the building that formerly housed the Royal Danish Conservatory of Music<>, </>Nobis is the sister property of the luxurious Nobis Hotel Stockholm, marking the Swedish hospitality group’s first foray outside of Sweden. The interiors have been designed to respect the building’s heritage, blending original period details with modern Scandinavian minimalism.</><>It has 75 rooms, including four suites, all of which contain high ceilings that provide the illusion of having even more space. Interior highlights include plush furnishings, such as the Duxiana mattresses on steel four-poster bed frames, Italian marble bathrooms, and bath products by Byredo – certainly better than your average list of amenities. Modern renditions of Nordic fare can be found at the hotel’s restaurant, NOI, and you can enjoy elegant seasonal cocktails at the sleek Marble Bar (which does an excellent espresso martini with butterscotch foam). It also has a wellness center with a pool, sauna, gym, and lounge – ideal for all of those hygge moments.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Copenhagen Cultural District</><>Distance From Airport:</>4 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Tivoli Gardens, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Danish Architecture Center, City Hall</><>Accessibility: </>Wheelchair accessible with two adapted rooms available</><>Rates:</>From $810 per night</><><h2> <>Hotel Ottilia</></h2><>Hotel Ottilia</><>Book Now</><>Also available to book at <>Travelocity</><>What We Like</><>It’s a dream destination for beer lovers, housed in the former Carlsberg brewery building. And in the spirit of imbibing, it has a wine hour and a nightcap hour, on the house for all guests.</><>What to Consider</><>The area is still being developed, so there aren’t as many shops and cafes nearby as there are in other neighborhoods.</><>This industrial hotel is housed in the former Carlsberg brewery building in the up-and-coming Carlsberg City district. It has a distinct façade lined with giant Instagram-worthy gold circles, and inside, you’ll find original architectural details, including steel beams and concrete walls.</><>The raw, minimalist theme continues throughout the hotel’s 155 rooms, dressed with herringbone floors with metal tables and clean, simple furnishings rendered in a mosaic of block-colored neutrals – think charcoals, tans, and icy whites. On top of the hotel, you’ll find Tramonto Rooftop – an Italian restaurant and bar with impressive 360-degree views across the city – a popular place for both locals and travelers during the warmer months. It also features a small fitness room and in-room fitness kits are available as well.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Carlsberg City District</><>Distance From Airport:</>8 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Copenhagen Zoo, Carlsberg Visitor Center, The Hillhouse Museum, Cisterns in Søndermarken Museum</><>Accessibility: </>Wheelchair accessible</><>Rates:</>From $138 per night</><>Wi-Fi: </>Complimentary, once you sign up for the newsletter</><><h2> <>Villa Copenhagen</></h2><>Villa Copenhagen</><>Book Now</><>Also available to book at <>Hotels.com</><>What We Like</><>It’s a travel industry favorite, renowned for running a slick operation and for its spacious suites.</><>What to Consider</><>It has 390 rooms, which is on the larger side for any hotel.</><>Since opening its doors in 2020, Villa Copenhagen has made a favorable impression among travel industry insiders, including Jaclyn Sienna India, founder and CEO at Sienna Charles, a luxury travel concierge. “My go-to accommodation is Villa Copenhagen, housed in a gorgeous century-old building. Their designer-furnished suites typically feature a master bedroom, a dining area, and a bathroom complete with a spacious freestanding bathtub.” Rooms are indeed more spacious than most in the city. As for the other highlights? “I highly recommend trying the pastries at their on-site bakery and the fish at the brasserie, which uses only locally-sourced ingredients,” India adds. “And I love starting my mornings doing yoga in the fitness room, and occasionally wrapping up the day with a session in the sauna."</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Vesterbro</><>Distance From Airport:</>5 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Nyhavn, Tivoli, Rosenborg Castle</><>Accessibility: </>Wheelchair accessible</><>Rates:</>From $303 per night</><><h2> <>The Darling</></h2><>The Darling</><>Book Now</><>What We Like</><>It has a homey ambiance; plus, complimentary slippers and a bottle of champagne are served on arrival.</><>What to Consider</><>There is no elevator as the building dates back to the early 1700s.</><>This exclusive guest house contains two beautifully decorated residences that feel like you’re staying in the private apartment of a hip Danish friend rather than a hotel that you’re paying for. There are abstract artworks, whimsical wallpapers, and stylish examples of Danish decor throughout – everything looks like it’s been carefully collected over time by someone with good taste.</><>If you’re looking for more of a residence-style accommodation, where you have all the facilities that a private apartment would offer, this is a great option, given it includes a kitchen, living room, dining room, and a study, in addition to a spacious bedroom and bathroom. The inaugural residence named “The Grand,” also has a private outdoor terrace overlooking The Church of the Holy Spirit – a tranquil place to enjoy coffee in the morning. And despite the residential-style set up, it has a concierge that can provide all the services you would be able to access at a luxury hotel, including a driver, a chef, a masseuse, and even a florist.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Amagertorv</><>Distance From Airport:</>6 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Strøget, Rundetaarn, Copenhagen University</><>Accessibility: </>Not wheelchair accessible</><>Rates:</>The Classic begins at $1,028 and The Grand begins at $1,352 per night</><><h2> <>Hotel Skt.

Nearby you will find notable historic attractions, including Amalienborg Palace, where the Danish royal family resides, as well as the Marble Church (Frederik's Church), Amalie Garden, and the Nyhavn neighborhood is just a three-minute walk away.</><>Accommodations vary from the penthouse to apartments, suites, and rooms that are suitable for solo travelers and couples, and the decor has a warm, lived-in feel.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Frederiksstaden</><>Distance From Airport:</>6 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Amaliehaven, Amalienborg Castle, Kongens Nytorv, Christiansborg Palace, Rundetårn, Castle Rosenborg</><>Accessibility: </>Wheelchair accessible</><>Rates:</>From $173 per night</><><h2> <>Hotel CPH Living</></h2><>Book Now</><>Also available to book at <>Expedia.com</><>What We Like</><>It is a floating hotel located on a boat – a unique option for anyone who is interested in experiencing an unconventional stay.</><>What to Consider</><>Given it's on the water, it is not for everyone, and it's not ideal for anyone who suffers from motion sickness.</><>For something totally unique, consider this floating boutique hotel docked in Copenhagen’s city center. It has 12 rooms throughout, designed with wooden floors, simple furnishings, and large windows with front-row views of the water – it feels like being on a very small cruise ship.</><>A basic breakfast is provided in the mornings, but there is no restaurant on site, so you’ll need to venture out for dining. One of the highlights is the terrace with sun loungers, which is lovely if you’re visiting over the summer months. If you’re a maritime enthusiast or enjoy hotels that are a bit more unconventional, this could be the place for you.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Christianshavn</><>Distance From Airport:</>4 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Danish Royal Library, National Museum of Denmark, Christiansborg Palace, Tivoli Gardens</><>Accessibility: </>It is not suitable given it is on a boat</><>Rates:</>From $123 per night</><><h2> <>SP34</></h2><>Hotel SP34</><>Book Now</><>What We Like</><>It’s a lively social hub, where you won’t feel the need to leave for dinner or drinks in the evening for a taste of the nightlife scene.</><>What to Consider</><>If you want some peace and quiet, this may not be the place, as it can be noisy with DJs and concerts on weekends.</><>SP34 is a hip establishment from the hoteliers behind some of Copenhagen’s most revered design hotels, and the group’s signature style is evident throughout, with Nordic decor and a cool, minimalist vibe. The 188-room hotel opened in 2014, with three restaurants (including an organic burger joint, a plant-focused bistro, and a casual eatery, Din Nye Ven), four bars, a private cinema, and a terrace across three connected apartment buildings.</><>There are exposed brick walls, calming neutral tones, and clean, minimal Scandinavian furniture is featured throughout. It’s a great place for creatives that thrive in a lively scene, and on Friday nights, there are DJs and musical acts, which is ideal if you want to immerse yourself in the local nightlife culture without having to leave the property.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Latin Quarter</><>Distance From Airport:</>5 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>City Hall Square, Strøget, gourmet food market, Torvehallerne</><>Accessibility: </>Wheelchair accessible</><>Rates:</>From $119 per night</><><h2> <>Radisson Collection Hotel, Royal Copenhagen</></h2><>Rickard L.

There are a variety of room types, but the hotel’s crown jewel is the Panorama Suite, which is almost 550 square feet and resembles a retro airport lounge. For dining, there is a Peruvian Japanese restaurant, ISSEI Copenhagen, that is not to be missed, as well as a classic breakfast selection. It is conveniently located near key transport hubs, vibrant neighborhoods, and key attractions, including Tivoli.</><h3> <>The Details: </></h3><>Neighborhood:</>Vesterbro</><>Distance From Airport:</>8 miles</><>Nearby Attractions:</>Christiansborg Palace, Tivoli Gardens, Rundetaarn</><>Accessibility: </>Wheelchair accessible</><>Rates:</>From $191 per night</><><h2> <>Know Before You Go </></h2><h3> <>Embrace the concept of <>hygge</></h3><>“The essence of&nbsp;hygge&nbsp;is something that is very unique, though hard to pinpoint, especially in the English language where it often gets translated to cozy,” says Mads Østergaard, U.S. head of PR and Press for VisitDenmark.&nbsp;“Hygge&nbsp;is more like a state of mind, an ambiance, a feeling, or a vibe. Think cozy sweaters, a warm fireplace, good friends around you, a laid-back feeling, family, the feeling of being sheltered. Though all that is not uniquely Danish, the Germans call it ‘Gemütlichkeit,’ the Norwegians call it ‘Koselig,’ and the Dutch call it ‘Gezelligheid,’ we are probably the only ones who use it as a verb. We can 'hygge' with each other. We can ask a good friend if we want to 'hygge.' As an adjective or an adverb, it constantly gets thrown around in the Danish language as a way of saying ‘nice.’ Was it a good party? Yes, it was ‘hygge-ligt.’ That shows how highly valued&nbsp;hygge&nbsp;is.”</><h3> <>Most people speak English </></h3><>“Undskyld, jeg forstår ikke, hvad du siger!&nbsp;Just kidding!” Østergaard jokes. “Practically everyone in Denmark speaks English. Nowadays, we start learning in first&nbsp;grade, but my grandparents’ generation spoke English very well, too. As a tiny nation that wants its voice to be heard on the world stage, we quickly realized that we needed to speak English.”</><h3> <>The best way to get around is by bicycle </></h3><>“About 50 percent of Copenhageners bike to work every day, including politicians and on rare occasions, the royals,” Østergaard says. “Biking is a safe, affordable, and green way to get around in the city, and continued municipal investment has made this number rise over the last years. Copenhageners might bike fast to get from point A to B, so watch out in rush hour. Luckily, most of our designated biking lanes are quite spacious. And if you’re not comfortable on the ‘iron horse’ as we call it, our new subway system will get you anywhere in the city with new improvements getting you to places like Sydhavnen in the southern part of Copenhagen.”</><h3> <>Experience the city like a local </></h3><>Østergaard recommends experiencing Copenhagen like a local. “Ride a bike through the biking lanes that snake through the city like green highways. Share a meal with Copenhageners at one of our great communal dining destinations. And if the temperature allows it, jump in the water in our clean canals at some of our designated harbor-baths. As a former Copenhagener, these were all part of my everyday life,” he explains. “And don’t just stay in the city center. Explore the many neighborhoods like the new Carlsberg neighborhood on the former brewing grounds of the beer giant with an eclectic mix of new and old architecture or the vibrant and multicultural neighborhood of Nørrebro. Or go even further – with a train ride of 30 minutes you can experience idyllic fishing villages with colorful houses like Dragør or see King Hamlet’s Elsinore with the Majestic Kronborg Castle overlooking the narrow strait between Denmark and Sweden.”</><h2> <>How We Chose These Hotels </></h2><>This story was written by T+L contributor <>Amy Louise Bailey</>who has spent time in Copenhagen and has family and friends that are currently living in the city.
